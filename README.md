## 🧠 **AI in the Project**

While **AI** is not explicitly used for prediction models, **real-time crowd density analysis** and **route optimization** can benefit from machine learning techniques. For example:
- **Crowd Density Analysis**: Data collected from various sources (e.g., sensors, cameras) can be processed and analyzed using AI models to predict crowd behavior, which could further enhance the accuracy of the real-time density updates.
- **Route Planning**: AI-driven algorithms could help optimize routes based on historical and real-time crowd data, predicting high-traffic areas and suggesting optimal paths with fewer delays.

In the future, machine learning and AI could be integrated into **Tafweej Hajj** to offer personalized, adaptive route recommendations, improving the experience for pilgrims by predicting behavior patterns based on past data.

### **Description of AI in the Project**:
In this `README.md`, AI is highlighted in the **Route Planning** and **Crowd Density Analysis** sections. The project can integrate AI techniques in the future to enhance the system's capability to predict crowd behavior, optimize routes, and provide personalized recommendations based on real-time data.

This is a solid foundation for your project, showcasing both current and potential future uses of AI. Let me know if you need further adjustments!
